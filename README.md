The project is a cryptography tower defense game. The game focuses on learning
methods of improving password security through stronger passwords, various hashing
functions, and additional password security features. As you progress, you gain points that let
you upgrade your towers based on these security topics, as well as unlock more advanced
cryptography methods. Each one is explained when unlocked and used to help the user get to
know them and how to optimally improve their passwords. More points can be earned by
upgrading the "master password" at the start with better security options chosen before each
round. You can use additional points to apply hashing methods of higher strength and
complexity, such as going from MD5 to bcrypt, in order to boost the stats of the towers even
more. Upon game end, the highest security passwords will be shown to you and why they are
secure.
